# Changelog

## 0.1.2 — 2026-11-12

Current snesrecomp and recomp-ui, and RecompLauncher's recommendations. The
framework brings its access-exact sound timing (a per-clock S-DSP), sprite
priority, brightness-rounding, HDMA and mosaic fixes: over the same test run
2799 of 3000 frames now match snes9x exactly, where 0.1.1 matched 2702. A
setting that needs a restart (renderer, audio output) comes back to the same
moment instead of starting the game over; a game that reads the controller
by hand gets fresh buttons on every read; a save state loaded in another
scene is no longer drawn with the previous scene's registers. Save states
now keep the CPU's place, so one loaded during the logos, a menu or the map
resumes where it was made. Save states from 0.1.1 keep loading, with the
music playing on (the old sound state is converted). With
[RecompLauncher](https://recomplauncher.com) the game builds on the
launcher's setup screen, Play goes straight into the game, Big Picture opens
full screen, and the renderer and shader are on the game's page. Controllers
are no longer read while the window is in the background ([General]
BackgroundInput = 1 restores that); the log keeps the last runs. The update
check on start stays; when RecompLauncher starts the game it leaves updates
to the launcher.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-11-03

### Changed
- A fresh install starts with **no shader** (the plain picture), the lightest
  option. A full-screen CRT shader made the game drop frames on weaker laptops.
  Pick CRT Lottes or another preset under Settings → Shader; your choice is
  still saved and kept. An install that already has a shader keeps it.
- On laptops with two graphics cards (NVIDIA Optimus, AMD switchable
  graphics), the game now asks for the **dedicated graphics card** instead of
  the integrated one.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-02

First release: a setup pack that recompiles the game from your own ROM. Boots
through the Capcom logo and title screen into the menus and fights. Fresh
installs start with the CRT Lottes shader; scanline, CRT and upscaler presets
(ScaleFX, NNEDI3); settings during play (Ctrl+L or Select+L3); audio
interpolation (I key: Gaussian, Cubic, Sinc); update check on start that backs
up your save states before installing; console-free Windows build. The title
logo's mosaic animation and the logo itself are drawn (renderer fix).
